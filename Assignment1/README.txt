In order to run the experiments from section 2, open the Experiments and Exercise 3.2.ipynb file. Run the first code block. In the second code block choose whether to use "wave" dataset by setting dataset parameter to string "dataset" and hence run the experiment without informative fetures or use "human" dataset by setting dataset variable to any other value in order to run the experiments without considering all features option.
To recreate the 3.1 exercise open the 3_1_script.ipynb file. Run the first two block cells to define function and the third cell to actually run the algorithm. Change the parameters to set the different setting described in the assignment. 
To recreate the 3.2 exercise open the Exercise 3.2.ipynb file. Run the first cell to define the functions. Then scroll past experiments to the cell with comment #data preparation  cell. Run this cell and the next cell to run the experiments.
